### Formula
Basic consumption formular based on BdE e.v. (https://www.energieverbraucher.de/)

<br>p = number of persons in the household
<br>wh = base 200 kWh if waterheating is electrically 550 kWh
<br>app = count of large appliances used
<br>s = living space in m¬≤

Consumption = p * wh * app * 200 kWh + s * 9 kWh

In a four-person household of an average family, there are eight large electrical appliances such as televisions or tumble dryers on 120 square meters of living space. 
The calculation here is therefore: 4 * 200 + 8 * 200 + 120 * 9 = 3480. 
3455 kWh of electricity consumption could be expected per year for this household.

<br><b>Usual electricity consumption depending on the living situation (without electric water heating)</b>
Size of Household | Type of Household | low | medium | high
------------------|-------------------|-----|--------|------
1 Person | Apartment | < 1000 kWh | 1000 - 1700 kWh | > 1700 kWh
1 Person | House | < 1800 kWh | 1800 - 3400 kWh | > 3400 kWh
2 Persons | Apartment | < 1700 kWh | 1700 - 2500 kWh | > 2500 kWh
2 Persons | House | < 2500 kWh | 2500 - 3500 kWh | > 3500 kWh
3 Persons | Apartment | < 2100 kWh | 2100 - 3300 kWh | > 3300 kWh
3 Persons | House | < 3000 kWh | 3000 - 4400 kWh | > 4400 kWh
4 Persons | Apartment | < 2300 | 2300 - 3600 kWh | > 3600 kWh
4 Persons | House | < 3500 kWh | 3500 - 5000 kWh | > 5000 kWh


<br><b>Average electricity consumption in apartments with and without hot water preparation**</b>
Size of Household | w/o elec. Waterheating | with elec. Waterheating
------------------|------------------------|------------------------
1 Person  | 1400 kWh p. A. | 1700 kWh p. A.
2 Persons | 2000 kWh p. A. | 2800 kWh p. A.
3 Persons | 2600 kWh p. A. | 3600 kWh p. A.
4 Persons | 2900 kWh p. A. | 4200 kWh p. A.


<br><b>Average electricity consumption in the house without and with hot water preparation**</b>
Size of Household | w/o elec. Waterheating | with elec. Waterheating
------------------|------------------------|------------------------
1 Person  | 2400 kWh p. A. | 2700 kWh p. A.
2 Persons | 3000 kWh p. A. | 3500 kWh p. A.
3 Persons | 3600 kWh p. A. | 4500 kWh p. A.
4 Persons | 4000 kWh p. A. | 5100 kWh p. A.
